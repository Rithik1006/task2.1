        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the 
            first known use of computer was in a 1613 book called The Yong Mans 
            Gleanings by the English writer Richard Brathwait: "I haue [sic] read 
            the truest computer of Times, and the best Arithmetician that euer 
            breathed, and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number." This usage 
            of the term referred to a human computer, a person who carried out 
            calculations or computations. The word continued with the same meaning 
            until the middle of the 20th century. During the latter part of this 
            period women were often hired as computers because they could be paid 
            less than their male counterparts.By 1943, most human computers were 
            women.</p></div>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">There are many types of education. Formal 
            education happens in a complex institutional framework, like public schools. 
            Non-formal education is also structured but happens outside the formal 
            schooling system. Informal education is unstructured learning through daily 
            experiences. Formal and non-formal education are divided into levels. 
            They include early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, 
            and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the teaching method, 
            like teacher-centered and student-centered education. Forms of education can 
            also be distinguished by subject, like science education, language education, 
            and physical education.</p></div>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, 
            skills, and character traits. There are many debates about its precise 
            definition, for example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A further 
            issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the
            student is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of critical 
            thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination. These disagreements 
            affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The term 
            can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people. 
            Additionally, it can mean the academic field studying education.</p></div>
